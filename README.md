# Simple API requester
A simple and easy to learn Python3 for people that want to learn how to connect to an API.

This script will connect to a website that generates random users for us to fetch through their API, convert it to JSON and then sort the data with both loops and IDs. I strongly recommend playing around with the filters and fetch different kinds of information to practice. If you are impatient, you can use my "filter.py" file while creating your script. 3 random users from the website are hardcoded into the script, so it will print a lot faster than connecting to the API all the time.
